Starr Apps to build your home server

- Transmission (torrents)
- Plex (library management)
- Overseerr (media discovery and request management)
- Prowlarr (indexers)
- Radarr (movies)
- Sonarr (tv shows)

Also, you can add import lists from (IMDB, Letterboxd, and many other options)

Start by creating the following volumes to mount:

- **Apps** is where your app config will live
- **Downloads** is where your torrent downloads will exist for a short period of time
- **Media** is where your content will live
- **Torrents** is where you can add manual torrents to watch (and start downloads from there, not very common, but required by Transmission)
